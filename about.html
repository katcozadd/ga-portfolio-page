	<p>I am Kat.</p>
	<p>I am Colorado grown, undeniably in love nature, the human experience and of all little things that life has to offer.</p>
	<p>In early 2018, I decided to take a leap of faith and transition out of working in the Food and Beverage Industry and into the world of Web Development.</p>
	<p>Crazy right? yeah... I know.</p>
	<p>Previous to attending a three month fully immersive web development course at General Assembly Denver, I had never typed a line of code in my life. Okay... that might be a bit of an exageration. I had coded a little bit before, but nothing that looked great or functioned at all. All I knew is that I wanted a change and working in a field that had boundless oportunities and vast growth sounded like a good place to start.</p>
	<p>So that was that, I decided that it was time to put my creative mind to work! So far so good, but check in with me on week 5...</p>
